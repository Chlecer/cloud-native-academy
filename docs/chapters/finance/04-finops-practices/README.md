## 📊 Cost Governance

### Monthly Cost Review Process
```python
# cost-review-automation.py
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def generate_monthly_report():
    ce = boto3.client('ce')
    
    # Get current month costs by team
    response = ce.get_cost_and_usage(
        TimePeriod={
            'Start': datetime.now().replace(day=1).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            'End': datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        },
        Granularity='MONTHLY',
        Metrics=['BlendedCost'],
        GroupBy=[{'Type': 'TAG', 'Key': 'Team'}]
    )
    
    # Generate team cost summary
    team_costs = {}
    for result in response['ResultsByTime']:
        for group in result['Groups']:
            team = group['Keys'][0] if group['Keys'][0] else 'untagged'
            cost = float(group['Metrics']['BlendedCost']['Amount'])
            team_costs[team] = cost
    
    return team_costs

# Send to Slack
def send_cost_report(team_costs):
    total_cost = sum(team_costs.values())
    
    message = f"📊 Monthly Cost Report - Total: ${total_cost:.2f}\n\n"
    for team, cost in sorted(team_costs.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
        percentage = (cost / total_cost) * 100
        message += f"• {team}: ${cost:.2f} ({percentage:.1f}%)\n"
    
    # Send to Slack webhook
    requests.post(SLACK_WEBHOOK, json={'text': message})
```
