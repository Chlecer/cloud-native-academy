# 🛠️ Operations - Production-Ready Infrastructure

> **Build and operate systems that don't break at 3 AM**

## 🎯 What You'll Master

- ✅ **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- ✅ **Monitoring & Observability** (metrics, logs, traces)
- ✅ **Incident Management** (on-call, runbooks, postmortems)
- ✅ **Automation** (CI/CD, deployment pipelines)
- ✅ **Performance Optimization** (scaling, caching, CDN)
- ✅ **Disaster Recovery** (backups, failover, RTO/RPO)
