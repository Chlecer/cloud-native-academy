## üõ°Ô∏è Overview

This learning path provides a comprehensive approach to securing cloud-native applications and infrastructure. You'll learn security best practices used by leading organizations to protect their systems against modern threats.

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

By completing this path, you'll be able to:
- Implement robust authentication and authorization systems
- Secure APIs and microservices architectures
- Protect cloud infrastructure and containerized workloads
- Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations
- Respond effectively to security incidents

## üèóÔ∏è Security Domains

### 1. [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](./01-auth-systems/)
**Secure access to your systems and data**
- Authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and session management
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and passwordless authentication
- Identity federation and single sign-on (SSO)

### 2. [API and Application Security](./02-api-security/)
**Protect your applications from common vulnerabilities**
- OWASP Top 10 security risks
- API security best practices
- Input validation and output encoding
- Security headers and Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Secure API design patterns

### 3. [Cloud Infrastructure Security](./03-infrastructure-security/)
**Secure your cloud environments**
- Cloud security best practices (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Network security and segmentation
- Secrets management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security
- Container and Kubernetes security

### 4. [Data Protection and Privacy](./04-data-protection/)
**Safeguard sensitive information**
- Data classification and protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Key management
- Data loss prevention (DLP)
- Privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

### 5. [Threat Detection and Response](./05-threat-detection/)
**Identify and respond to security incidents**
- Security monitoring and logging
- Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Incident response planning and execution
- Digital forensics
