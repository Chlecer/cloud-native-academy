> **Complex concepts explained simply**

## 🎯 Quick Definitions

### **What's DevOps?**
Making software go from idea → users quickly and safely

### **What's Kubernetes?** 
System that runs many apps without them breaking each other

### **What's CI/CD?**

## 🏠 **Simple Analogies**

### **Kubernetes = Building Manager**
- Your App = Tenant
- Pod = Apartment  
- Node = Building
- Kubernetes = Building Manager

The manager finds apartments, fixes problems, and keeps everyone safe.

### **CI/CD = Pizza Kitchen**
- Developer = Chef (writes code)
- CI = Kitchen (tests the pizza)
- CD = Delivery (gets pizza to customer)

If the pizza is good → deliver it. If bad → back to chef.

### **Git = Time Machine**
- Commits = Snapshots in time
- Branches = Parallel timelines
- Merge = Combining timelines

You can go back to any snapshot or create alternate versions.
