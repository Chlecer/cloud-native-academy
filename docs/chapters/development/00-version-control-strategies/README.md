## Trunk-Based Development (TBD)

### Core Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: All developers work on short-lived branches from `main`
- **Continuous Integration**: Multiple integrations per developer per day
- **Feature Flags**: Manage feature releases without long-lived branches
- **Small, Atomic Changes**: Encourages small, focused commits

### When to Use
- Teams practicing Continuous Delivery/Deployment
- Mature DevOps culture with strong test automation
- Projects requiring rapid iteration and feedback
- Organizations with monorepos

### Example Workflow
```bash
# Start a new feature
git checkout -b feature/new-authentication main

# Make small, focused commits
git add .
git commit -m "Add login form component"

# Frequently sync with main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Push and create pull request
git push -u origin feature/new-authentication
# After PR approval, squash and merge to main
```

## GitFlow

### Core Principles
- **Strict Branching Model**: Defines specific branches for features, releases, and hotfixes
- **Release Preparation**: Dedicated release branches for stabilization
- **Versioned Releases**: Clear versioning through tags
- **Parallel Development**: Supports multiple versions in production

### When to Use
- Projects with scheduled release cycles
- Teams needing to support multiple production versions
- Regulated industries requiring rigorous change control
- Open source projects with many contributors

### Example Workflow
```bash
# Start a new feature from develop
git checkout -b feature/payment-integration develop

# Work on feature
# ...

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/payment-integration

# Start a release
git checkout -b release/1.2.0 develop
# Fix bugs, update version numbers

git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0

# Update develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/1.2.0
```

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Aspect                | Trunk-Based Development         | GitFlow                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Branching**         | Short-lived feature branches    | Long-lived branches              |
| **Integration**       | Multiple times per day         | Before releases                  |
| **Release Cadence**   | Multiple per day               | Scheduled releases               |
| **Complexity**        | Low                            | High                             |
| **Learning Curve**    | Low                            | Steep                            |
| **Best For**          | CI/CD, cloud-native            | Versioned releases, monoliths    |
| **Team Size**         | Any, better for larger teams   | Better for smaller teams         |
| **Tooling**           | Requires CI/CD                 | Simpler CI/CD requirements       |

## Integrating with CI/CD

### Trunk-Based CI/CD Pipeline Example
```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
  - test
  - build
  - deploy

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm test
    - npm run e2e

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t myapp:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
    - docker push myapp:$CI_COMMIT_SHA

deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy
  environment: staging
  script:
    - kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=myapp:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  only:
    - main

deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  environment: production
  script:
    - kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=myapp:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  when: manual
  only:
    - main
```

### GitFlow CI/CD Pipeline Example
```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
  - test
  - build
  - release
  - deploy

# Runs on all branches
test:
  stage: test
  script: npm test

# Only run on develop and release branches
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t myapp:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG-$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
    - docker push myapp:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG-$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  only:
    - develop
    - /^release\/.*$/

release:
  stage: release
  script:
    - ./bump-version.sh
    - git tag -a v$(cat VERSION) -m "Release $(cat VERSION)"
    - git push origin v$(cat VERSION)
  only:
    - /^release\/.*$/

deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=myapp:main-$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  only:
    - main
```
