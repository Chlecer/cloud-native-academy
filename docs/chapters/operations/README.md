## üèóÔ∏è Overview

This learning path transforms you into a professional Cloud Operations Engineer, teaching you how to build, deploy, and maintain highly available, scalable, and reliable cloud-native systems. You'll learn the same practices used by top technology companies to ensure their systems are always available and performant.

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

By completing this path, you'll be able to:
- Design and implement highly available cloud infrastructure
- Monitor and troubleshoot complex distributed systems
- Automate operational tasks and deployments
- Manage incidents and post-incident reviews
- Optimize system performance and costs
- Implement disaster recovery strategies
