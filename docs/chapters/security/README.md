# 🔐 Security - Protect Your Applications

> **Security practices that prevent real-world attacks**

## 🎯 What You'll Master

- ✅ **Authentication & Authorization** (OAuth, JWT, RBAC)
- ✅ **API Security** (rate limiting, input validation)
- ✅ **Infrastructure Security** (secrets management, network security)
- ✅ **Container Security** (image scanning, runtime protection)
