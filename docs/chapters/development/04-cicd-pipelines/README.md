# 🚀 CI/CD Pipelines: How GitHub Deploys 100+ Times Per Day

> **The inside story of how GitHub went from 1 deploy per week to 100+ deploys per day - and the CI/CD revolution that changed software forever**

## 💥 The Deployment Hell That Nearly Killed GitHub

**2008 - GitHub's Dark Ages:**
- **Manual deployments** every Friday at 5 PM
- **3-hour deployment process** with 47 manual steps
- **50% failure rate** - deployments often broke production
- **Weekend emergency fixes** became the norm
- **Developers afraid to ship** new features

**The breaking point**: A failed deployment on Black Friday 2008 took GitHub offline for 8 hours, losing $2M in potential revenue.

**2024 - GitHub's CI/CD Mastery:**
- **100+ deployments per day** with zero manual intervention
- **11-second average deployment time** from commit to production
- **99.95% deployment success rate**
- **Zero downtime deployments** using blue-green strategy
- **Developers ship features** within hours of writing code

**The transformation**: GitHub's CI/CD pipeline now processes 500M+ deployments annually for their customers.

## 🎯 The Netflix Deployment Revolution

### How Netflix Deploys 4,000 Times Per Day to 200M Users

**Netflix's Scale:**
- **4,000+ deployments daily** across 700+ microservices
- **200M+ users** can't tolerate downtime
- **190+ countries** with different compliance requirements
- **15 petabytes** of content delivered daily

**Netflix's Secret**: Spinnaker - the deployment platform that changed everything.

## ⚡ The Shopify Black Friday Deployment Freeze

### How Shopify Handles $7.5B Sales Day with Zero Deployments

**The Challenge:**
Black Friday is Shopify's Super Bowl - $7.5 billion in sales processed in 48 hours. **One bad deployment could cost merchants millions.**

**Shopify's Strategy**: Complete deployment freeze during Black Friday.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Shopify's Black Friday Deployment Freeze Script

# Black Friday Deployment Freeze (November 24-27)
BLACK_FRIDAY_START="2024-11-24 00:00:00"
BLACK_FRIDAY_END="2024-11-27 23:59:59"

check_deployment_freeze() {
    current_date=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    
    if [[ "$current_date" > "$BLACK_FRIDAY_START" && "$current_date" < "$BLACK_FRIDAY_END" ]]; then
        echo "🚨 DEPLOYMENT FREEZE ACTIVE"
        echo "Black Friday period: No deployments allowed"
        echo "Emergency contact: @shopify-oncall"
        
        # Block all deployments
        exit 1
    fi
}

# Pre-Black Friday: Intensive Testing
prepare_for_black_friday() {
    echo "🛠️ Preparing for Black Friday deployment freeze..."
    
    # 1. Load test at 10x normal traffic
    echo "Running Black Friday load tests..."
    k6 run --vus 100000 --duration 2h black-friday-load-test.js
    
    # 2. Chaos engineering tests
    echo "Running chaos engineering tests..."
    chaos-monkey --target production --intensity high --duration 4h
    
    # 3. Database performance validation
    echo "Validating database performance..."
    pgbench -c 1000 -j 100 -T 3600 shopify_production
    
    # 4. CDN cache warming
    echo "Warming CDN caches..."
    curl -X POST "https://api.shopify.com/admin/cdn/warm-cache"
    
    # 5. Final deployment before freeze
    echo "Deploying final pre-Black Friday version..."
    deploy --version stable-black-friday-2024 --confirm-freeze-ready
    
    echo "✅ Black Friday preparation complete"
    echo "🔒 Deployment freeze will activate at $BLACK_FRIDAY_START"
}

# Emergency deployment process (requires C-level approval)
emergency_deployment() {
    echo "🚨 EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT REQUEST"
    echo "This requires approval from:"
    echo "- CTO: Tobias Lütke"
    echo "- VP Engineering"
    echo "- On-call Director"
    
    read -p "Enter emergency approval code: " approval_code
    
    if [[ "$approval_code" != "SHOPIFY-EMERGENCY-2024" ]]; then
        echo "❌ Invalid approval code. Deployment blocked."
        exit 1
    fi
    
    echo "⚠️ Emergency deployment approved"
    echo "📊 Monitoring will be intensified during deployment"
    
    # Deploy with extra monitoring
    deploy --emergency --monitor-intensive --rollback-ready
}

# Check freeze status before any deployment
check_deployment_freeze

# Normal deployment process
if [[ "$1" == "emergency" ]]; then
    emergency_deployment
else
    echo "✅ Normal deployment window - proceeding"
    deploy --standard-process
fi
```

**Shopify's Black Friday Results:**
- **$7.5 billion processed** with zero deployment-related issues
- **99.99% uptime** during peak traffic
- **Zero emergency deployments** needed during freeze period
- **Peak traffic**: 80,000+ requests per second handled flawlessly
